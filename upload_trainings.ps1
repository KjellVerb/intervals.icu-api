.SYNOPSIS
    Upload trainings from a JSON file to Intervals.icu

.DESCRIPTION
    This script reads a local "trainings.json" file, formats each training according 
    to the Intervals.icu API specifications, and uploads them via a bulk endpoint.

    Make sure to update:
      - $ATHLETE_ID
      - $API_KEY
      - $BASE_URL (if needed)
      - $zoneType (HR, Pace, or whichever you need)
#>

# --- Configuration ---
$ATHLETE_ID = "ID"                 # Replace with your Intervals.icu athlete ID

$BASE_URL   = "https://intervals.icu/api/v1/athlete"
$zoneType   = "HR"  # e.g. "HR" or "Pace"
